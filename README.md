## Description

A maze can be generated with spanning tree using graph nodes representing grid. [Maze Generation Algorithm - wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)

Some algorithms to find minimum spanning tree include Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm. This program animates maze generation with the two. You can see the difference.

Additionally, it contains creating spanning tree maze with no loop random DFS.
